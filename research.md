**``The demographic origins of premature deindustrialisation''.**\\
Draft coming soon!

This paper asks whether accelerated demographic transitions contribute to premature deindustrialisation and lower output per capita. Using country--year panels, I show that within-country variation in the young-adult share predicts manufacturing employment within non-agriculture (and lower services shares) conditional on GDP per capita and fixed effects. Youth shares before the manufacturing peak also predict the hump’s height. IPUMS microdata for 80+ countries reveal strong life-cycle sorting: manufacturing is youth-intensive while low- and high-skill services rise with age. I interpret these patterns through a task-based sector choice model in which workers’ efficiency in physical and fluid-cognitive tasks declines with age, while efficiency in crystallised/interpersonal tasks rises, shifting comparative advantage toward services; switching costs and idiosyncratic tastes generate gradual reallocation. On the demand side, cohorts accumulate a manufacturing-produced durable, so younger cohorts---starting without a stock---spend more on durables and tilt demand toward manufacturing. A calibrated multi-sector OLG model, disciplined by the reduced-form elasticities and life-cycle moments and using O*NET to map task intensities to sectors, quantifies how alternative demographic paths reshape equilibrium sectoral allocations, manufacturing peaks, and output per capita.




**``Financial frictions and Structural Transformation: A Quantitative Trade Approach''**, *with Santiago Etchegaray.* \\
Draft available upon request

This paper shows financial frictions are a quantitatively important driver of cross-country heterogeneity in structural transformation trajectories, with relevant implications for output. Empirically, we document a robust relationship between financial development and the employment shares of manufacturing and high-skilled services, conditional on GDP per capita. Motivated by this, we introduce heterogeneous firms and financial frictions into an open economy model of structural transformation, in which limited access to external finance generates comparative disadvantage in finance-intensive sectors. Calibrated to match cross-country patterns from 1990-2010, eliminating financial asymmetries in the model closes roughly half of the gap in average manufacturing employment between flat- and steep-manufacturing economies—those with muted versus traditional structural transformation paths. It further results in an increase in the share of global output of flat-manufacturing economies of around 3.3 percentage points.




**``A Trade Based Optimal Voting Rule for the International Monetary Fund''**, *with Martín Gonzalez-Eiras.* \\
Draft available upon request

We study how IMF voting power should be allocated when crisis lending generates asymmetric cross-border spillovers and is financed collectively by the membership. We develop a quantitative Ricardian trade model with capital and asymmetric exporter frictions, and we derive optimal voting weights and contributions as each member’s ex-ante welfare sensitivity to IMF intervention, net of expected financing costs. We compare two polar environments: a balanced environment with homogeneous crisis risk to an imbalanced environment in which high-yield members are more likely to request assistance. Optimal weights depart sharply from size-based quota rules. When crisis risk is concentrated, voice shifts towards high-yield economies and their close trading partners, while advanced net creditors retain influence but cede relative ground. Results are robust to sensible variations in funding cost, the decision threshold, and shock magnitude. Participation remains attractive for all members because contributions align with expected net benefits. The framework offers a transparent, data-anchored mapping from cross-border externalities to voting weights in multi-lateral institutions.




**``Tariffs in a Networked Economy with Capital Goods''**, *with Rubén Domínguez-Díaz, José-Elías Gallegos and Javier Quintana.*

We build a multi-country, multi-sector New Keynesian model in which international production networks span both intermediate inputs and capital goods, so that tariffs create price wedges that propagate not only through supply chains but also through investment decisions and capital accumulation. Motivated by the idea that capital adjustment is central for understanding the long-run effects of trade wars, the framework emphasizes two features of capital goods: their durability—so reduced investment has persistent effects—and the sparsity/concentration of the investment network, with many capital goods sourced from a small set of country–sector producers. To discipline this channel, the paper incorporates a novel investment-network dataset mapping origin country-sector to destination country-sector, alongside standard input-output linkages. This enables a quantitative assessment of how extreme tariff shocks affect aggregate output and inflation—and how much of that impact is accounted for by the capital-goods channel.
