"**The demographic origins of premature deindustrialisation**"\\
<span style="color:#7A1E2C;">Draft coming soon!</span>

This paper examines whether accelerated demographic transitions—by shrinking young‑adult cohort shares earlier—contribute to premature deindustrialisation and lower output per capita. Using country–year panels and cohort-size variation driven by fertility 25–34 years earlier, I show that youth shares predict higher manufacturing employment and larger manufacturing “humps,” while earlier ageing shifts employment toward services at lower income levels. Using harmonised IPUMS census microdata for 80+ countries I document pronounced life‑cycle sectoral sorting and wage–age gradients consistent with age-dependent task returns; a calibrated multi‑sector OLG model with frictional sector choice and life‑cycle demand quantifies the equilibrium and output consequences of alternative demographic transitions.



"**Financial frictions and Structural Transformation: A Quantitative Trade Approach**"\\
*<span style="color:#1B5E20;">with Santiago Etchegaray</span>* \\
<span style="color:#7A1E2C;">Draft available upon request</span> 


This paper shows that financial development predicts larger manufacturing and high-skilled service employment shares conditional on GDP per capita. Calibrating an open-economy heterogeneous-firm model to 1990–2010 data, I show that borrowing constraints tax finance-intensive manufacturing and high-skilled services, flattening manufacturing humps. Removing financial asymmetries halves the manufacturing-employment gap between flat- and steep-hump economies and raises the flat-hump group’s share of global output by 3.3 percentage points.


"**A Trade Based Optimal Voting Rule for the International Monetary Fund**"\
*<span style="color:#1B5E20;">with Martín Gonzalez-Eiras</span>* \\
<span style="color:#7A1E2C;">Draft available upon request</span>

We study how IMF voting power should be allocated when crisis lending creates cross-border spillovers and is financed collectively. In a quantitative Ricardian trade model, optimal voting weights equal each member’s ex-ante welfare sensitivity to intervention net of expected financing costs, implying sharp departures from size-based quota rules. When crisis risk is concentrated among high-yield members, voice shifts towards them and their key trading partners; results are robust, and participation remains attractive because contributions align with expected net benefits.




"**Tariffs in a Networked Economy with Capital Goods**"\\
*<span style="color:#1B5E20;">with Rubén Domínguez-Díaz, José-Elías Gallegos and Javier Quintana</span>*

We develop a multi-country, multi-sector New Keynesian model with production networks in both intermediate inputs and capital goods, so tariffs propagate through supply chains and investment, affecting capital accumulation. The model stresses capital durability and the concentration of capital-goods sourcing, and is disciplined using a new investment-network dataset linking origin to destination country–sectors alongside standard input–output tables. We use the framework to quantify the output and inflation effects of large tariff shocks and isolate the contribution of the capital-goods channel.


"**The Global Reach of EU Regulation: Evidence from Third-Country Trade**"

This paper tests the “Brussels effect”: whether EU non-tariff measures (NTMs) shape not only trade with the EU but also third-country trade in the same products. Using UN TRAINS NTM data matched to HS6 bilateral flows from UN Comtrade/WITS, it estimates how changes in EU NTMs affect the comovement between an exporter’s shipments to the EU and its shipments to non-EU destinations, controlling for tariffs and rich fixed effects. The results show a positive and significant propagation effect, consistent with EU regulation influencing firms’ global market choices.
